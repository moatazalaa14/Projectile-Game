# Projectile-Game

## Brief
My challenge is to build out this Projectile Game 

## User background
- the user should know the simple physics of projectile motion under the effect of the gravity force only
- can calculate the initial velocity and angle to hit the enemy accuratly

users should be able to:

- Add initial Velocity 
- Add the angle degree which the gun fire from it 
- Display the gun with the angle degree
- Display the enemy and determine the place of point of enemy 
- Fire the Projectile to try to hit the enemy
- display the time , horizontal distance and elevation
- Display moving for Projectile into canvas 
- Display feedback for user if he hit the enemy successfully 
- Reset all data to play again

## Getting started

1. click on ```Show off The Enemy``` it will display the enemy as point and the distance from the gun.
2. determine ```Velocity``` and ```Degree``` then click on ready(it will display the gun with the required angle)
3. click on ```Fire``` to try to hit the enemy
